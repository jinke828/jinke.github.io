Hello! This is Jin.

I am an incoming PhD student (24 fall) working with [Dr. Marvin Chun](https://www.marvinchun.com/) at Yale University.

I obtained my B.S. in Psychology and Environmental Science from Peking University, where I worked with [Dr. Xin Zhang](https://www.psy.pku.edu.cn/szdw/qzjy/fjs/zx/index.htm) on emotion perception and memory. I then completed a M.A. in Psychology from the University of Chicago with a certificate in Computational Social Sciences. I worked with [Dr. Boaz Keysar](https://mdl.uchicago.edu/) on my master's thesis studying trust in uncertainty.

Currently I work as a research specialist in the Cognition, Attention, and Brain Lab led by [Dr. Monica Rosenberg](https://cablab.uchicago.edu/) and as a research assistant in the Computational Affective and Social Neuroscience Lab led by [Dr. Yuan Chang Leong](https://mcnlab.uchicago.edu/). My ongoing research tries to explore the neural signature of spontaneous thoughts during rest, and a common neural code for affective experiences during naturalistic movie watching.
